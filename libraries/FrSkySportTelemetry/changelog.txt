  [NEW] Added usage example for the FrSkySportSensorXjt decoder class (FrSkySportXjtDecoderExample)
  [NEW] Added decoding of ADC1, ADC2, RSSI, SWR and RxBatt data to FrSkySportSensorXjt
  [NEW] Added decoding of vertical speed from FVAS sensor (not documented in FrSky spec, added based on OpenTX sources)

Version 20151108
  [FIX] For combined values decoded by the FrSkySportSensorTaranisLegacy sensor the data ID is only returned when complete value has been decoded
